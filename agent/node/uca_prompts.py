    "5. Do not invent objects or actions that were not present in the input evidence.\n"
    "6. Keep sentences factual and surveillance-oriented (no speculation, no emotions, no judgment).\n"
    "7. UCA style cues: describe subjects generically (\"a man\", \"two men\", \"a woman in red\", "
    "\"a white car\"); refer to the scene with simple surveillance phrases (\"on the screen\", "
    "\"in the middle of the road\", \"behind the counter\", \"in the corner\"); chain actions "
