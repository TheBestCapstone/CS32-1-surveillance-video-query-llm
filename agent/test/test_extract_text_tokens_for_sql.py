"""Unit tests for `extract_text_tokens_for_sql` after the P0-4 stopword cleanup.

Focus areas:
  - content words previously blacklisted (person, car, moving, area, clothed)
    now survive, either as direct tokens or deduped through filter_terms
  - plurals are normalized so the SQL LIKE path does not search on both
    "persons" and "person"
  - genuine function words (the, are, is, with, from, for, this, that, ...)
    are still stripped
  - emitted list is deduped and bounded by the limit cap
